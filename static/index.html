	<h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>

	<h4>Hi, there! I'm Ellen - foodie, world traveler, adventurer, volleyballer, social activist, student, and aspiring UX designer.</h4>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p><b><i>About me -</i></b> I'm currently an undergraduate student at UC San Diego studying Cognitive Science, specializing in Human Computer Interaction, with a minor in Management Science.</p>
	
	<p><b><i>Design is everywhere -</i></b> Although I grew up in Los Angeles and am studying in San Diego, the world is my home.  I have always wanted to see new places and try new foods, and recently, I had the opportunity to study abroad for two semesters (Quebec and Hong Kong) and to volunteer abroad (South Africa) over the summer.  In the near future, I plan to study abroad again in Athens and Berlin.  While traveling, it was fascinating to see the different cultures and lifestyles of the different locations and, more importantly, the design that lives in every part of the world.  I still have a lot to learn about design, but I'm very eager to continue learning and growing my design skills to help others and to make life easier.  The less time one has to spend figuring out how to use something and being frustrated at the poor design of it means more time for traveling. Or adventuring. Or eating. Or hiking. Or napping. Or whatever it is people like or want to do.</p>

	<tr><td>	
		Our app, Phetch, is intended to help housemates by limiting conflict and confrontations and by keeping things organized and in one place.  Some features that our app includes are finances, a chore wheel, an inventory, a shopping list, and a grocery-store-notifier.

	</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
		As a team of five, we designed a logo for our team and an app that is meant to assist housemates in living together.  Since this was a design class, there was much mure emphasis on the design phase than on the implementation phase.  Even though my role on the team was a designer, we all were very involved in each step of the process.  Some of the design tools we used were:
		<ul>
			<li>Brainstorming ideas on butcher paper as a group</li>
			<li>Individually sketching ideas</li>
			<li>Personas and storyboards</li>
			<li>Multiple prototypes (paper and digital) and user testing</li>
			<li>Documenting our progress in a blog</li>
		</ul>
